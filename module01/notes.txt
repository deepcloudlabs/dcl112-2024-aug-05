1. Imperative Programming: procedural programming, oop
   Problem -> Algorithm -> Solution
2. Descriptive/Declarative Programming: oop, fp
   Problem -> Solution
Software Development -> Abstraction/Modeling
   Problem (Real-World) -> Domain: banking, insurance, telecommunication, e-commerce,...
   Requirement Gathering -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Test -> Deployment -> Maintenance
   Requirement Model -> Analysis Model -> Design Model -> Source Code -> Test Model -> Deployment Model
Memory: OS/Process -> Heap, Stack, Text, Data
Procedural Programming
   procedure -> c function -> Data/Heap
Object-Oriented Programming
  i. Class: Data <- Function, Object -> Encapsulation + Information Hiding Principle
     Modeling Tool: members: data/state/property/attribute: iban, balance, methods: deposit, withdraw
     DDD
 ii. Inheritance   -> Reusability
iii. Polymorphism  -> Agility + Open/Closed Principle
